EpicBoard is an Electron app for creating and managing Epics. Epics are a planning tool to encapsulate a bunch of work that needs doing. Think one large project, like a new document editing system (like my example below) or a large software migration.

All text containers implement the wonderful [DraftJS](https://draftjs.org/) WYSIWYG editor which allows for your usual Github-flavored markdown on-the-fly.

As an Electron app, I'm able to easily offer releases on Mac, Windows, and Linux. See the releases page!

A simple saving mechanism exist where you can point it to any system folder. If you want to sync to Drive, Dropbox, or anything else, just point EpicBoard to your automatically synced folder.
